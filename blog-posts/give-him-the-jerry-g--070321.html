      <h3>Give Him the Jerry G</h3>
<pre>
I watched "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On_the_Waterfront"  target="_blank">On the Waterfront</a>" last night. A "classic" 1950s movie about a mob run waterfron union and its victims. Marlon Brando was the star and the female lead was the interestingly named "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eva_Marie_Saint" target="_blank">Eva Marie Saint</a>". I had previously seen her in "North By Northwest" as the femme fatale/love interest but did not recognise her until after the movie. She is very attractive and i think her pale looks made her stand out in the black and white era. 

The plot is typical: An unlikely hero emerges who stands up to a corrupt union and the  previouly intimidated but now inspired workers band together in solidarity and disover that the mob is only powerful in the darkness. Apparenly it's loosely based on a true story, and the real person sued the movie studio and got some money. 

The gangsters mostly had Italian/Russian/Irish surnames but otherwise did not display any other ethnic features. 

As everyone says, Brando plays this character well and his performance in this movie seems to have encouraged a lot famous actors to get into the business. Eva Marie Saint's character was completely helpless and only there for the Hero to protect and fall in love with, which is typical for female characters of <strike>the era</strike> most movies until relatively recently.
 
Some of the slang used in the movie is not immediately obvious and i was googling some of the phrases as i watched and didnt always get clarifying results. I wish i had kept a list. 

I liked it.
