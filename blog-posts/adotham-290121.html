      <h3>A dot Ham</h3>
<pre>
I went to see <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamilton_(musical)" target="_blank">Hamilton</a> on Thursday. We had purchased the tickets back in March, when May seemed like a long time to wait. I didn’t know they were playing in Sydney until they were here. It was in the <a href="https://www.openstreetmap.org/node/1460582139" target="_blank">Sydney Lyric Theatre</a> at 7PM, which is attached to the Star Casino. We caught the train and light rail to get there. The theatre did not waste an opportunity to sell things to us (apparently a programme is $25) and the drinks were massively overpriced but that is to be expected.

I don't have much to say about the show, other than it was very enjoyable. You can’t help being at awe at the effort it must take to set up and design a show like this. I had never been to a musical before but I plan to go more often. The medium is interesting, it's visually very bold and unlike a play or movie it demands 100% attention to be able to follow along. I wonder how musicals will fare in a age where subtitles are considered a <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/outlook/2020/02/13/you-should-watch-everything-with-subtitles/" target="_blank">necessity</a>. I found myself sometimes wishing for subtitles during the show.   

The show was performed on a spinning stage <a href="https://boingboing.net/2018/06/05/what-inspired-the-hamilton.html" target="_blank">wheel</a> that helped with movement and transitions between scenes. It's a very smart idea that is used to great effect in the show and really puts the whole thing together.  

Nearly all the cast were non-white. This is an <a href="https://www.abc.net.au/news/2021-03-10/hamilton-australia-cast-lin-manuel-miranda-final-rehearsals/13233616" target="_blank">intentional</a> choice by Lin Manual Miranda. The cast was very good, but I think it might confuse some of the audience into believing that "people of colour" actually had the ability to rise to positions of influence in 1700s America. I wonder how many people in the audience (especially a non-American one) realised that literally every historical figure in the play was actually white. 

The audience was pretty mixed, but it skewed towards people who could afford a $100+ for a ticket. There was a row of high school children in the two back row who definitely will have a different high school experience then I did. A few rows down from us there was an enormously large couple, each needed two seats but only purchased one. The Lady next to them was very unfortunate and should have complained to the staff as there were better empty seats available. The group to my left was a couple and their grown daughter who wanted to pay her father back for the water he got her. To our right were two Irish women and their kids both who gossiped a lot about people they knew during intermission. There was a cynical "mandatory mask" policy that was not enforced. The theatre was at full capacity and they had broken the unwritten rule that if you are going to mandate masks, you also need to give more space through social distancing, plus, they might lose money on drinks. Most people had a mask covering their mouth but not their nose. It must be what women in Iran feel like when they go to the cinema.   

This show has become a cultural milestone and is definitely worth seeing.
