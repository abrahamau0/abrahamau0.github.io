      <h3>Mouse</h3>
<pre>
My mouse wrist has been more sensative recently, so I've been trying to find a nice ergonomic mouse. There are a lot of form factors but they all have some level of vertical tilt. 
All the premium (I.E. Expensive) ones have various certifications but I suspect these are just things you buy from self appointed bodies that allow you to put a "certified" sticker on the packaging.
Matresses have this dyanic going on too.

I originally bought a <a href="https://archive.vn/hr79D" target="_blank">Kmart Vertical mouse</a>. It was the same vertical mouse that a lot of generic manufucturers package sell. 
It wa OK, but it was too light, pressing the button would make the mouse move (and hence the cursor), so i gave it away and looked for a better one.

The one i settled on was the <a href="https://archive.vn/S8qme"  target="_blank">Microsfot Sculpt Ergonomic Mouse</a>. Looking at how my wrist and hand natually set on a table, I am convinced that this has the right tilt. 
It matched my natual resting position perfectly, unlike a completely vertical mouse which requires wrist twisting. 

So far so good, I coupled it with a mousepad that has a wrist rest and the combination has done a lot to reduce the sensativiy i was having at the end of the day.
