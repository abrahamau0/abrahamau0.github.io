      <h3>Christening</h3>
<pre>
I Went to a Baptism yesterday; I hadn’t been to one in about 5 years. The child was about two years old. Apparently, the words Baptism and Christening are used interchangeably, both words have historic and interchanging definitions, but it seems to have ended up that "Baptism" is the act involving the water and "Christening" is the act of giving the child it's Christian name. 

The Church it was held at follows a Greek Orthodox tradition. I've always liked the way those churches are styled with its distinct Iconography and the Mediterranean looking representations of Jesus and the saints. The prayer process is very different to that of the other churches, and the byzantine chants thought out the service are very seductive. You get the feeling that not much of the proceedings have changed over the centuries. 

Afterwards there was a party with plenty of food, drink, and dance. I’m not a big drinker, so the little i consumed had an effect on me. I saw some people i hadn’t seen in a while, and met some people i knew of but hadn't met until yesterday. The Music (an ethnic band) was too loud. 

I got home around 10PM (It is essentially a children’s event after all) and went to sleep.
