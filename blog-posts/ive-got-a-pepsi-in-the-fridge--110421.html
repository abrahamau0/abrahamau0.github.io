      <h3>I've Got a Pepsi in the Fride</h3>
<pre>
I watched Basic Instinct last night. Every time I think about the film, I come up with a new interpretation of it. I'm not even sure I like the movie. It's one of those movies where in the end the director leaves everything up for interpretation. The film is an erotic/psychological/whodunnit thriller starring the very attractive Sharon Stone, Michael Douglass and a sultry Jeanne Tripplehorn. There is endless debate about who the real killer is on the internet and It's left unclear in the movie but there is no real answer, every explanation is a valid possibility and that's probably an intentional choice by the director. I doubt even he knows for sure. 

It's that intentional ambiguity that gives me mixed feelings about this movie. I'm not someone who necessarily prefers neat endings to films (To me, the ending of most movies are boring and predictable) but watching this, I felt a little cheated. I would have liked it more if I felt the director knew who it was even if he didn’t want to definitively reveal it, but everything I’ve read about it suggests he doesn't. Anyway, the movie has become a cultural reference point (due to one scene) so I’m glad I’ve seen it.

Last week, on the easter long weekend, I watched Total Recall (I had never seen it either) starring Arnold Schwarzenegger and featured Sharon Stone. It was standard science-fiction fare. Like a lot of Mars related Sci-fi, the plot involved a colonized Mars, and an exploited class of Martian people breaking free from earth. It was an action movie and not particularly deep. In this world you can buy memory implants of holidays that are sold as completely indistinguishable from reality. 

I wonder if this would work in practice, or would knowing that it was fake make it feel fake? Schwarzenegger’s character undergoes this holiday procedure and buys the "extra option" of being a spy on mars. The procedure goes wrong and as a result there is no way of telling if the plot of the movie is a brain malfunction or if it actually happened. Like Basic Instinct, fundamental parts of the plot are completely up for personal interpretation.
