      <h3>Emergency Cancellation Archimedes</h3>
<pre>
I watched <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forbidden_Planet" target="_blank">Forbidden Planet</a> a couple of days ago. I had seen bits of it before as as teenager on the old TNT network when it was dedicated to showing classics. I remember being enamored by it, although back then that might have mostly been down to the alluring Anne Francis stage presence. 

I decided to rewatch this film after I realized that the Commander (Commander Adams) was played by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FzBuGMPGTC8" target="_blank">Leslie Neilson</a>. He is not an actor I am particularly familiar with and I've always regarded him as a very funny comedic actor and "from the 80s". I was surprised to find out that he had always had ambitions to play "Leading Men" which had been met with mixed success. It wasn't until later in his career that he embraced being a comedic actor. 

The movie’s plot is sophisticated for 1950s sci-fi, and is considered to be a loose adaption of Shakespeare’s "The Tempest". Sci-fi movies of that era was often put in the same genre as horror and most of them where Xenophobic in their outlook. 

Sex is really at the undercurrent of this movie. The beautiful and young Altaira is the sole female on a desert planet and before the spaceship landed, she and her father (Dr Morbius) where the only two humans for lightyears. She has an unusual ability to tame wild animals which disappears once she loses her innocence and begins to interact with the all-male crew from the spaceship. There are hints that she and the commander had sex when they were alone in the desert ("I'm terribly ignorant but I have had [...] biology Of course, that's mostly on the theoretical side.  Well, so far." Altaira  challenges the captain before the scene changes).

There is a beast roaming the planet that wants to kill everyone except for Doctor Morbius and his daughter. It is later revealed that the Krell (an extinct alien race) had been on the cusp of removing themselves from the physical nature of the universe and becoming pure energy. The plan failed after they had forgotten to account for their beginnings as an animalistic, jealous and lustful species which still lurked in their Id. Dr Morbius had tampered with this device, and it turns out the Monster, unbeknown to him, was his Id. 

Her Fathers Id does not want his daughter to leave the planet. Is this a father’s natural instinct to protect his daughter? Is it something more? The movie does not suggest anything untoward, but when he puts on the Krell intelligence-meter it conjures an image of his daughter. Is that the result of an obsession or just natural concern? He also seems to have neglected to educate his daughter on the nature of relationships between men and women to the point that she can be tricked into "hugs and kisses" by crewmen under the guise of keeping warm. Did her father neglect this aspect of nature for his own purposes? or Maybe he stills sees here as a child. Perhaps I am applying a modern lens onto things, these movies have always been commercial enterprises and well, sex sells. 

This movie does not depict an earth world and the crew do not have a Christian moral to guide them. Unlike the sci-fi movies that it followed this movie is not about "good Christian god-on-its-side earth" vs "godless aliens". WWII was not your great grandfathers war when this movie was released and the crew mimic WWII soldiers and the Navy ethos. They come from a society where good vs evil does not play a role. Death is not new to them and hedonistic pleasure is desired (alcohol or sex). The society they come from is facing new challenges bought on by technological triumph. Moral questions can no longer be answered from traditions. Star Trek, 2001 A space odyssey, and even Doctor Who also come from post-modernist frame. I wonder if this movie had any influence on them. 

This movie is a harbinger of how sci-fi movies would be made in the future. The move away from “Monsters from out-of-space” into more philosophical introspective has only continued. Asimov had already published the meat of his “Foundation” series when this movie was released which in many ways created a backdrop on which modern sci-fi could be layered.  

I am woefully ignorant of most of Shakespeare’s work, this is something I plan to improve on.
