<h3>In Which I Start A Blog</h3>
<pre>
So I have decided to start a no-pressure blog.
I will write an entry down when i feel like it, and only when i feel like it.
I plan to use it to orgasnise my thoughts and very likely rant.

Initally i considered using wordpress, but its just has too many layers. Then i considered a "static site generator" like <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a>.
I like jekyll, but it still seems unnencessary. I get why people would use Jekyll (auto insterted entries and navigation is nice), i might eventually end  up using it.

But as I know basic html/css i decided to cobble it together myself.
I like this minimilist style and it works. All i really have to do going foward is copy this page and change the div that contains this text (and then add the page to the index).
Its very little effort, and it means i can host it literally anywhere.

Who knows though, I might end up making my own site generator (just for fun)
